My name is Piotr Kalinowski. This is my website.

I am a software engineer. I solve problems in software, whether it means
implementing new features, fixing existing ones, or figuring out how to avoid
problems in the future. I've been doing it professionally for over 10 years.

When I'm not working on software, I like to read, play some computer games and
ponder the nature of life, universe, and everything else.

Eventually, I will also write something here.
